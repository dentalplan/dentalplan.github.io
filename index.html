	<p><strong>Cliff Hammett</strong> is:</p>
		<ul><em>
			a new media meddler </br>
			an errant diagrammer</br>
			an occasional poet</br>
			a sometime illustrator</br>
			a creative tinkerer</br>
		</ul></em>

		<p>
			I develop critical and playful investigations into a number of phenomena.  These have included jokes, 
			field ecology, card games, genetic algorithms, co-word analyses, errant temporalities and many others. 
			From this work I produce workshops, walks, games, strange devices, diagrams and texts, as a means
			both to further and to share my investigations.	
		</p>
		<p>
			Collaboration is key to my work. I worked with <a href="http://www.motheringamplified.com">Alexandra Joensson</a> 
			and the <a href="http://www.xtalkproject.net">x:talk collective</a> on the <a href="http://xmsg.org.uk">x_msg project</a>, 
			an SMS-based social software system for use by sex work activists.  In 2011, we were given an Award of 
			Distinction in the Digital Communities category at Prix Ars Electronica for x_msg. Following this, I've become part
			of <a href="http://www.commonhouse.org.uk/whos-involved/autonomous-tech-fetish/">Autonomous Tech Fetish</a>,
			who run technologically focussed workshops in the Common House, in east London. I'm also a member of the
			<a href="http://www.opensystem.org.uk">Open Systems Association</a>, 
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm concerned with how power inheres in complex systems, and how the indeterminacy of these systems can transform 
			relations for better or worse. I'm interested in subverting quantitative cultures, the mutually transformative 
			relationships struck between technologies and animals, and interconnections between forms of time and violence. I'm a 
			practicing poet and illustrator, often producing work in collaboration with <a href="http://www.drfulminare.com">Sidekick Books</a> 
			and <a href="http://www.fuselit.co.uk">Fuselit magazine</a>.
