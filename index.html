        Cliff Hammett is a critical maker, a new media meddler and a technical tinkerer. His investigations take place at the 
        junctures between ecological, technical and social concerns. These experiments generate works and events that open up 
        challenging issues and phenomena to a range of participants and publics. Cliff works across media and practices, employing 
        hardware design, software development, illustration, poetry, walking events and co-making workshops.

        Collaboration is key to Cliff’s work. In 2011, he and fellow researcher <a href="https://alexandrajoensson.com/">Alexandra Jønsson</a> 
        received an Award of Distinction in the Prix Ars Electronica for <a href="/collaborations/2011/08/01/collab-xmsg/">x_msg</a>, 
        an SMS-based sex work activist telephony system developed with the <a href="https://www.xtalkproject.net">x:talk project</a>. 
        He has subsequently worked with Alexandra and a range of other practitioners, as core members of the collectives 
        <a href="/collaborations/2012/08/01/collab-osa/">Open System Association</a> and 
        <a href="http://cliffhammett.com/collaborations/2014/06/01/collab-atf/">Autonomous Tech Fetish</a>,
        and has contributed to multiple titles published by collaborative press <a href="https://www.sidekickbooks.com">Sidekick Books</a>.

        Cliff is currently undertaking an AHRC-funded PhD in Creative and Critical Practice at the University of Sussex. His thesis project, 
        <a href="http://cliffhammett.com/collaborations/2017/11/01/nightsniffing/">Nightsniffing</a>, combines live walking events and bespoke 
        data devices to open up the relationship between bat ecology and the systems that underlie urban change and contestation.
