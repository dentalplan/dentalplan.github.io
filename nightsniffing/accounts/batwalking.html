<h1>Some quotes from participants</h1>

<h3>Perception</h3>
<p class="quote">We saw something flying past and hoped it was a bat and actually it turned out it wasn't, it was a bird, usually. I think when you have a bat detector, you are far more reliant on your ears than your eyes. Especially when it's quite dark.</p>
<p class="quote">When you hear the clicking, there’s that initial thing of ‘ah, I got something’ but then remember to look up to the sky and not look at your clicky thing! Because that’s what I was doing, I was looking at that although that was where the bat was going to be. I had to remind myself – don’t look at that, look up at the sky.</p>
<h3>Anxiety</h3>
<p class="quote">Especially when it’s just one person or a couple of people watching you walk around… you feel like a bit of a… geek, for want of a better word. And they’re thinking – what the hell are you doing? And I want to explain: it’s about bats!</p>
<p class="quote">[The bat detector] also just amplifies the amount of stuff that's in the air. And that's not necessarily a good feeling, of knowing there is all this […] it just amplifies the fact you can't access, there are all these spectrums of information you can't access. You feel fundamentally inadequate.</p>
<h3>Collectivity</h3>
<p class="quote">you were urged to move your body to try and reach them, it felt a bit like you are dancing [...] it felt like everyone was throwing their arms around and running after the bat, like trying to get into the rhythm of finding them.</p>
<p class="quote"> I also now get as much enjoyment from watching other people react to seeing bats for the first time, so there's a real sense of satisfaction [...] especially the young kids, and even adults, seeing that wonderment and oh wow they've not seen it before.</p>
