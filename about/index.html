		<p><strong>Cliff Hammett</strong> is:</p>
		<ul><em>
			a new media meddler </br>
			a 'nose' philospher</br>
			an occasional poet</br>
			a sometime illustrator</br>
			an errant diagrammer</br>
			a creative tinkerer</br>
		</ul></em>

		<p>
			I develop critical and playful investigations into a number of phenomena.  These have included jokes, 
			card games, genetic algorithms, co-word analyses, errant temporalities and many others. I tackle these 
			individually, or with members of the <a href="http://www.opensystem.org.uk">Open Systems Association</a>, 
			of whom I'm an active member.
		</p>

		<p>
			Alongside this, I've been working with <a href="http://www.motheringamplified.com">Alexandra Joensson</a> 
			and the <a href="http://www.xtalkproject.net">x:talk collective</a> on the <a href="http://xmsg.org.uk">x_msg project</a>, 
			an SMS-based social software system for use by sex work activists.  In 2011, we were given an Award of 
			Distinction in the Digital Communities category at Prix Ars Electronica for x_msg.  
		</p>

		<p>
			I've longstanding interests in indeterminacy in complex systems, the [something] of animal life, different 
			forms of time and several strains of ethics/political philosophy. I'm a practicing poet and illustrator,
			often producing work in collaboration with <a href="http://www.drfulminare.com">Sidekick Books</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.fuselit.co.uk">Fuselit magazine</a>.
