        I performed the experiment this morning
        two slender conical tubes soldered from very thin brassplate
        little bells and strips of leaf metal
        sound whenever  touched  [straunge things are delectable]
        with a pair of scissors I removed completel the eye-balls
        and when they were
        with beating incorpored: I
        made a lossenges and trociskes
        therof
        The animal (which could see)
        closed the tubes with pitch so that
        the animal did not fly at all
        and it frequently fell.
        I had overlooked the microphone
        the space between tub and conch
        the air had no passage to the internal ear
        showed no influence
        but I heard it as
        wel  as if I had been by it
        an high treble to the voice
        of beasts, to which as a mean,
        the running of riuers was a
        tenor
        When I saw it was so indeed
        and that I vnderstood
        glad was I as any
        man aliue, surprised and delighted to hear a medley of raucous noises
        the moouing
        of dead, as windes, waters,
        trees, carts, falling of stones,
        with many things else,
        as ringing of belles, counting of
        coines, mounting of groines
        the jangling of a bunch of keys
        inharmonic components,
        the loudspeaking of the sonic detector popped
        and
        could discern all voyce, but
        by means of noyses
        vnderstand none.
        I think that
        they hear the sound (romor) of the wings and of the body
        eleven blinded individuals
        plugged ears with bird-lime
        sounds can penetrate
        in other species
        their structure is different
        I neuer looued belles since
        the high frequency sounds
        the apparatus
        lead one far astray
