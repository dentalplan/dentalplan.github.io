    <p>'Spallanzani watches the walker' is a performance that takes place in low light. It consists of three main components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> A small audio device contained GPS data from a segment solitary bat walk I undertook 
        in late 2014. Bat walking is a practice of walking at night with an ultrasound detector in order to locate bats 
        in both rural and urban locations. It can be carried out systematically to build datasets, in groups as public 
        engagement events, and by hobbyists and enthusiasts. The GPS data was sonified by using a music progamming language 
        to translate the data into sine waves, pitch and panning. During the performance I listen to this through noise 
        cancelling headphones. The sonification is never shared directly with the audience or with any other individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> My body, to be specific, that originally went on the nightwalk. It could have been 
        another body; it may be worth noting those attributes of my body that might determine my safety and confidence in 
        solitary nightwalking. Added to it are coins, keys and jewellery, all of which may be carried on nightwanders, all 
        of which can generate sound at frequencies above human hearing. I shake and move my body according to the sonified 
        GPS, which conveys several attributes of the data through rhythm, tone and panning.</li>
        <li><strong>Detector:</strong> Heterodyne ultrasound detectors, which tune into frequencies of ultrasound and 
        render them at frequencies we can hear. Each one is tuned to a common frequency used for bat detecting in London. 
        These detectors pick up the ultrasound generated by the coins, keys and jewellery as my body moves to the sonified 
        GPS data. For the performance, two (or more) bat detectors are held by audience members. 
    </ul>
    <p>Material from the original performance is present along two routes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href='leg/1/'>first route: the walk</a></li>
        <li><a href=''>second route: the __</a></li>
    </ul>
