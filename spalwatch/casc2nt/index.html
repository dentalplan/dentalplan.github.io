            Analysis of segment of video from performance. Extracts are determined by the relative movements of 
            the right and left knees to each other, with images taken at the points where the knees are closest
            and furthest from each other. Each image pair is illuminated according the level of change
            in the image. The composite images are cascaded, with the recorded video times displayed along side it.
        </p>
        <p>The corresponding audio segment has likewise been broken up according to the 
         movements of my knee. Parts have been sped up or slowed down, so that each recorded movement has the 
         same amount of time given to it, and has been recombined into a single piece of the same length as the 
         original segment.</p>
