        "The National Grid system covers Great Britain in 100km squares
        between the bridge and clothes animal
        was but the difference of a few hundred paces
        sites are generated randomly
        unstable land or unsafe parts of town
        fast dry clicks
        a deeper, richer popping
        that could place you
        a terrible rawness of nerves
        what we do to
        how is it possible to
        not nightly jumble
        times and places
        times troubled by our own sleeping inconsistencies
        you cannot listen on all the frequencies
        survey for different species
        listen only for particular species
        a halfpennyworth of excuse
        to the toll-keeper
        her isolation is felt in
        a bodily throwness
        a blunt pattering on the pavement
        sharp dogs
        imaginary dogs
        who come unexpectedly
        come unexpectedly into
        flickering sparks
        the last veritable sparks
        the rattling of
        capital
        mingled with this
        a new heart,
        my next object
        beetle-browed
        a loose bundle of
        hands
        we could not keep in focus
        what we do to
        what it fully shows us
        Never survey alone
        The lines that vertically run left to right (west to east)
        progressing eastward
        I assume we all believe that bats have experience"></img>
