In 2011 I was invited by the editors of Sidekick Books to illustrate a co-authored book of sonnets inspired by London's Tropical Zoo (then in Syon Park). The zoo is a home for unwanted pets and illegally traded animals.  The resulting work was first published as a one-off print run to be sold by the Tropical Zoo, and then later republished as 'Riotous'.

It is available to purchase from the [Sidekick Books website](http://www.drfulminare.com/riotous.php).
