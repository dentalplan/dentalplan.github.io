Heterodyning refers firstmost to a process in which two signals are mixed in order to convert up, or down, the signal. It is of vital importance to many forms of analogue media electronics: you will find such a circuit in most radio receivers, every VCR (if you can find a VCR). It has more ecletic uses, from detecting the ultrasonic signals of bats to the analysis of classical poetry, and its etymology (literally potential through difference) is tantalising and suggestive.

This project is at present an attempt to trace out some of the areas and intersections of the places this process touches upon. Its starting point is to explore the practice of bat detection using heterodyning, tracing out its relationship to the creation of place, the recognition of value and politico-economic processes such as gentrification. From there, the plan is to turn the links between these processes and data generation, technoaesthetic cross pollineation and conceptual parallels to the mathematical form of the heterodyne.
