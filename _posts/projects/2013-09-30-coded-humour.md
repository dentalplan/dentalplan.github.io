Q: How many prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?
A: Yes.

Software development often uses rational structures that separate out different objects, processes and types of data. But what happens when these structures capsize and produce a result that is outside our normal expectations.

This project explored and created programs that have structural relationships to jokes, but they are not intended to produce jokes that would make humans laugh. Instead, they attempt to think through how something like the structures and dynamics of humour might operate in formal languages, and come to the fore in strange and surreal ways.

The resulting software and explorations were presented as part of the Abandon Normal Devices Fair, FACT Liverpool in 2013.
