Ever timed the cooking of eggs by how much bread you could butter? Or counted the gurgles of a fridge to tell you when the tea was brewed? Time scales is a small set of experiments exploring time as a relationship between physical processes, to produce a set of temporal ratios for kitchen practices and procedures without reference to normative metrical time. These ratios are then manifested in the properties of foodstuffs and utensils – temporality mapped out in comparisons of weight, colour, volume, smell – creating a sensorial database of time relations. These experiments are part of an ongoing investigation into errant temporalities.
