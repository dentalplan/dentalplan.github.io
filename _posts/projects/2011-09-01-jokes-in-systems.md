A Clockwork Exception is an interactive installation consisting of a buggy clock which attempts to pull the viewer into its own system of self-regulation. It is a physical diagram of the joke, understood as an automaton which breaks the governing heuristic of control through sheer repetitive stupidity. This break causes the clock mechanism runs out of control, leaving the viewer either to assist in altering the heuristic to regain stability, or else leaving it to find a new stable configuration by itself.
