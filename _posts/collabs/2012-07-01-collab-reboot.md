Rebooting Computing a response to the scrapping of the ICT curriculum and a renewed focus on teaching programming. 
It is a partnership between [Southend Education Trust](http://www.southendeducationtrust.co.uk/), [Digital Exploration Centre](http://www.digitalexplorationcentre.com), 
[YoHa](http://www.yoha.co.uk) and [Goldsmithsâ€™ Centre for Cultural Studies](http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/) in London.
 
As one of seven participating members of the Open Systems Association. As well as assisting with organisation and planning, Cliff designed one of three 
open-source Arduino projects especially for this hack day. Details can be found in the [Rebooting Computing wiki](http://reboot.yoha.co.uk).

OSA is continuing to develop strategies to bring out the social and cultural aspects of computing whilst teaching code and technical skills. 
Through this a wider group of students can be engaged beyond those typically interested in IT.
