[Autonomous Tech Fetish](http://www.commonhouse.org.uk/whos-involved/autonomous-tech-fetish/) (ATF) is an open space for gathering, sharing and making. We explore how digital technology is fetishised and how we can respond â€“ to defetishise it or refetishise into new forms, new configurations that serve our needs and desires. In this way, we can question why technology has been made a certain way? Who has it been made for, and who has been excluded? How does or can it restructure our bodies, minds, desires?

As part of the [Common House](http://www.commonhouse.org.uk), ATF is looking to work with different groups to affirm the technological autonomy of political activism, helping it overcome surveillance and control. Beyond this, we are committed to co-education, creating spaces where pitfalls and hidden potentials of technologies can be explored without assumptions, to play with the innards of the physical and abstract machines that surround us.
