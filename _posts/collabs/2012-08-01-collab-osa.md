The [Open Systems Association](http://www.opensystem.org.uk) is an allotment society for the critically curious and the technologically disaffected. Based out of the Centre for Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths, it develops experimental methodologies to expose, share and engage with the complex ecologies, brutal control systems and intimate technologies that surround and envelop us.

Cliff is a (sometimes hyper) active member of the association.  He assists its operations on various levels, has led several sessions and activites, and is part of the Everything but the Kitchen project.
