As part of my preparations for taking part in the [Abandon Normal Devices Fair](http://www.andfestival.org.uk/events/and-fair/) at FACT, Liverpool, I've created a new Anomie game board. Hopefully this is a more visually satisfying version that will help people to engage with the game. I've changed a few of the rules from the [original version](/scrap/2011/02/17/anomierules/) - notably, Jacks and Queens now have the same functions, and the only cards that matter are the ones on top at the end of the game.

The above is a low res image - printable version are available from github [here](https://github.com/dentalplan/jokesinsystems/tree/master/anomie/GameBoard2013) (note it needs to be printed on A2, or on two A3s which is probably cheaprer).

Or - if you find github a little tricky to negotiate here are direct links:

* [Anomie - full A2](https://raw.github.com/dentalplan/jokesinsystems/master/anomie/GameBoard2013/ANOMIE_newboard_full_A2.png)
* [Anomie - A3 left side](https://raw.github.com/dentalplan/jokesinsystems/master/anomie/GameBoard2013/ANOMIE_newboard_A3_left.png)
* [Anomie - A3 right side](https://raw.github.com/dentalplan/jokesinsystems/master/anomie/GameBoard2013/ANOMIE_newboard_A3_right.png)

Of course - you don't need the board at all in order to play. It's just there to make things easier.
