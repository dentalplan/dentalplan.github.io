![Error message in code](/resources/img/scrap_debug.jpg)

I carried out a workshops today with students from the [MA Interactive Media](http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-interactive-media-critical-theory-practice/) at Goldsmiths and members of the [Open Systems Association](http://www.opensystem.org.uk). The focus was both practical - developing the skill set to debug code - and conceptual. The latter side was focussed on the connections between the processes by which we look for error in software, and the cognitive processes which give us the capacity for jokes and humour.

In case you want your own go at debugging the scripts from the workshop, I've uploaded them to [github](https://github.com/dentalplan/jokesinsystems/tree/master/codedhumour/debugworkshop).
