thumbalt: cursed code from hexmsg

_Machbeth to witch 1._

Say from whence</br>
You owe this strange intelligence, or why</br>
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</br>
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</br>

_Witches vanish._

For Moving Forest, hex_msg recited/regurgitated Mathew Fullerâ€™s 500 Slogans by parasiting on networked text messaging. A software machine that interweaved user text messages with prophetic insurgent soundbites between 26th of July and the 5th July. Through its algorithmic intelligence, it sought connections with the information sent through it, then spat out slogans in response, masquerading them as messages from people on the networks.

You fuckers.</br>
This is a brutal definition.</br>
We can take over this signal.</br>
We can eat this street.

In the run up to Moving Forst, people throughout London joined the hexmsg network to gain underground information, co-ordinate, communicate, distribute strange intelligence. On the day of the insurgency, it served principally as a conduit to pose questions to the Hexists' River Oracle.
