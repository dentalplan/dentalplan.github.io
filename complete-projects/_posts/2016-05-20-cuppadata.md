Cuppa Data is an experiment in exploring
data, by blending human and machine feelings using tea.

Our actions and interactions with different technologies,
institutions and companies are increasingly captured in
data. Nevertheless, most of the time we don’t ‘feel’ when
the body is captured, nor when its actions are actively
producing data. What happens if our data is given back
to us as something we can taste and digest?

The tea-blending method brings together 'how the
machine thinks you feel' and 'how you think you feel'
using data captured with our galvanic skin
response glove. This measures the conductivity of sweaty
skin which is believed to give indications of people’s
emotions. 

Cuppa Data was first produced by Autonomous Tech Fetish for Data Buffet - part of the
Museum of Contemporary Commodities in Exeter. For the final
event, three unique teas were composed using data from a host of people who
have lent their bodies to the making of this artwork.
These include staff and visitors in Exeter Library Cafe,
Sid’s Cafe in St Sidwell’s Community Centre and the ATF
community in London. 

We also blended new teas together with vistors, allowing them to respond
to intimate, yet amplified personal readings of the newest government
data policies through our customised listening-aids. The emotional responses 
generated allowed us to serve up a hot mix of bodily data.
