Clocks are now part of daily life, and it's hard for some to imagine people operating without one. But of course clocks were once far rarer and far less reliable, and people had different ways of telling the time. These included the length of shadows, the position of the sun over mountain peaks, reciting prayers to measure cooking time and many more. 

This project takes a very simple indicator of time - the level of light in the environment - and tries to treat it systematically enough to turn it into a personal alarm clock. It uses rudimentary electronics and basic programming structures to create a device that can double as alarm clock and environmental sensor. The project explores methods for taking sensor readings over time, and explores the creation of a simple logical programming structure responding to both user and sensor input. 

It was developed for the Rebooting Computing hack day at Metal in Southend-On-Sea.  More details on this project, including a tutorial, can be found here.
