Atmospheric map of domestic knowledges (amodk) is a collective sense based practice for people who share common space. Taking a feminist and embodied approach to power and space, the project nurtures and validates multifaceted sensing of shared spaces, attending to small but affecting details like the condition of walls, the colour of paint, lingering smells, the arrangement of furniture and the noise of traffic from outside. In the amodk process, participants turn sensations into recommendations, and slowly unearth hierarchies within institutional spaces of care, education, health and even private homes.
The maps are created through a digital tool, which lays out imagery and conversation in uncertain relation. The format surfaces the difficulties of grappling with technologies of power in our everyday surroundings, whilst privileging the perspectives of those who depend on each space.

This project is an ongoing experiment to create new grounds for conversations about spaces and in whose favour they work. Building upon a feminist understanding of the relationship between bodies and environments, amodk provides a tool to redraw a space from the senses.

amodk was organised by artists Alex/Alexandra Sofie JÃ¶nsson and Cliff Hammett, designer Kamilla Mez, and movement facilitator Clara Dybbroe Viltoft, and developed with community organiser Erica Figueiredo and artist Sandro Masai.
