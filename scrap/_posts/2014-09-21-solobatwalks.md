*Over the last few weeks I've been going on solitary walks with my heterodyne bat detector. These have been in London, Norfolk, Edinburgh, but especially in Deptford/New Cross in preparation for a walk with the New Cross Commoners. Often I would spend up to two hours with headphones plugged in to the device; it is the same basic technology as a radio receiver and the sound produced is thus very similar. Below are reflections on the sometimes fevered experience of solo bat walking, written for an OSA event on [distraction](http://opensystem.org.uk/events-news/2014/10/08/distraction-camp-part-1.html).* 

Psssssss. The constant static of the heterodyne detector is exhausting. Admist the fuzz and whirr coming from my headphones I think I hear distant bat calls. So faint... was that a slap, a pipistrelle sounding out its meal? The blown raspberry of a feeding buzz? No, just a mental artefact, a result of my tired attempts at concentration, a whispery parody of those who found the voices of the dead in the noise of cassette tapes. Sometimes I click my fingers in front of its microphone to remind me of what sound actually sounds like. 

This doesn't help with other mistakes. I follow a constant, rhythmic sound that stays steady as I follow it - till I realise it is the scraping of my keys in my own pocket. Keys are just one of the objects that begin to stand out - not just mine, bags now jangle from across the street. Cars emit a new purr too, bicycles sound like noisy office fans. When walked they are like a tombola. Electrical substations make a strange humm at 40khz, and building sites give out a range of high-pitched tones. What are they? Security systems, special equipment? These sourceless sounds prompt anxiety, whereas the rattles of bicycle wheels and engines are almost warm and reassuring. I turn through frequencies, find little above 70khz; lower down the city's whispers become audible.

The combination of white noise and headphones muffles my hearing. This, and my diverted attention as I rove the night-time city in search of life, can lead me into some odd situation. I become lost easily - I track my movements with GPS, but the device doesn't have mobile internet so I can't correlate it to a map position - it just draws an abstract shape. In a south London meadow, I think I see a bat fly beneath a pathlight. I can't follow where the bat is going, but I can investigate the direction it flew from. I walk along the edge of the meadow, along a verge of trees. After a minute of walking I look round and see a fox walking directly towards me. I'm spooked - this is not how foxes normally behave. I don't know what it might do, so I back away. It follows me as I walk, and under the influence of the anxiety inducing static I feel convinced it is firmly escorting me off its territory. Once back on the path, I happen upon a ultrasounic throbbing coming from the concrete rail bridge that borders the meadow. I'm puzzled, unnerved. A second fox appears at the park entrance and looks at me. I stare back a moment, then make a quick pace out through a tunnel. My mind turns; explanations, rationalisations tumble between heart beats.
