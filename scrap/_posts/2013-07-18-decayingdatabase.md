![A time relation expressed as the difference between a length of a piece of pepper and a red line. The pepper is decaying](/resources/img/scrap_decayingdatabase.jpg)

The sensorial database I created to exhibit my [Time Scales](/ongoing-projects/2013/06/23/timescales/) project has begun to rot. Here is one part of it - the relative difference in time between slicing a pepper and recording a process in a graph, expressed as the difference between a piece of pepper and a red line. It appeals to me - creating a time database that is itself extremely transitory. Perhaps in a future instantiation I could use this, express a relation between two processes through the tendency of each material to decay at different rates.
