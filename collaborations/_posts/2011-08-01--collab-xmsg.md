x_msg was a project that focusses on sex work activism, social telephony and rewired technology.  We devised assemblages of software, hardware and mobile in consultation and collaboration with the London based sex worker-led collective, [x:talk](http://www.xtalkproject.net), to create a communication platform aimed at people working in the sex industry. The system was developed to respond to prominent social problems that the women in the industry face. It met the need for anonymity, considered language barriers, and used the most common, but private, technology: the mobile phone.

x_msg was co-led by Cliff Hammett and [Alexandra Joensson](http://www.motheringamplified.com).  In 2011 it won an Award of Distinction in the Digital Communities category in the Prix Ars Electronica.
