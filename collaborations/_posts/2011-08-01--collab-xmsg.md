[x_msg](http://xmsg.org.uk) is a project that focusses on sex work activism, social telephony and rewired technology.  Assemblages of software, hardware and mobile telephony are devised in consultation and collaboration with the London based sex worker-led collective, [x:talk](http://www.xtalkproject.net), and is aimed at women involved with the sex industry. The systems are being developed to respond to prominent social problems that the women in the industry face. It meets the need for anonymity, considers language barriers, and uses the most common, but private, technology: the mobile phone.

x_msg is co-led of Cliff Hammett and [Alexandra Joensson](http://www.motheringamplified.com).  In 2011 it won an Award of Distinction in the Digital Communities category in the Prix Ars Electronica.
