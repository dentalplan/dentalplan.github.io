The [Open Systems Association](http://www.opensystem.org.uk) was an allotment society for the critically curious and the technologically disaffected. Based out of the Centre for Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths, it developed experimental methodologies to expose, share and engage with the complex ecologies, brutal control systems and intimate technologies that surround and envelop us.

Cliff was a (sometimes hyper) active member of the association.  He assisted its operations on various levels, led several sessions, workshops and activites, and was part of the Everything but the Kitchen project.
