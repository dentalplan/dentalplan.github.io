*Bleaching. Sucking. Feeding. Clocking. Scouring. Tuning.*

This collective material enquiry explores how time is produced through the relations between physical processes and is restructured through cultural and political techniques. Engineered, commodified and consumed, kitchen time becomes labour time sold as leisure, but could we make it something different? Could we carry with it the wetness, warmth and sheer burning alkalinity of the substances, practices and forces we find within its walls and streaming through its windows?

Everything but the Kitchen is a collaborative framework devised by members of the [Open Systems Association](http://www.opensystem.org.uk). It seeks to tinker with unseen energies, unrecognised practices and unpaid forms of physical, emotional and material labour which fall outside normative notions of time. A first exhibition was held in June 2013 at Harts Lane Studios.
